# Optical-Character-Recognition-OCR-using-Fourier-Transform
Fourier Transform (FT) and Euclidean distance-based OCR method is implemented. It extracts frequency features of a character such as digits and alphabet. MATLAB has been used as an implementation tool for different preprocessing techniques like cropping, resizing, Edge detection, and filtering purposes.
